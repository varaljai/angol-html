    <h1>Bahamian Christmas Traditions</h1>
    <p>On Christmas eve in most Bahamian homes the kids are put to sleep early so the parents can do some last minute preparations such as decorating, preparing food and wrapping gifts, usually over some wine until everything is done and every drop of wine is finished.</p>
    <p>Christmas day shares similarities with American traditions; the day is full of eating tasty meals, talking and conversations with laughter followed by a night of dancing and music.</p>
    <p>Christmas morning wouldn't be Christmas morning without a big meal, so most households enjoy a dish called <span class="highlight">souse</span>, which is a savory soup consisting of onions, lime, peppers, meat and celery.</p>

    <p>After breakfast, the afternoon is spent relaxing maybe with a few naps in order to stay awake during the big night waiting. Dinner is comparable to its American counterpart, since its inclusion of Turkey with cranberry sauce and potato salad, but the centerpiece is glazed ham with pineapple and maraschino cherries.</p>
    <p>The ham is soaked overnight to remove unwanted salt, then it's roasted to dry off. Meanwhile, a sticky glaze is made from the pineapple juice, brown sugar, butter, and mustard, which is basted on the ham before it goes in the oven. As the final touch, the cherries and pineapple are placed on the ham with the help of toothpicks. At the table, it is served with peas and rice, macaroni and cheese, followed by guava duff dessert.</p>

    <p>After round two of eating and giving presents and gifts, there is not much sleep as the Junkanoo starts at 2 AM.</p>
    <p>The streets start the parade with lights, music and dancing.</p>
    <p>The Junkanoo is one of the biggest celebrations of the year, and it lasts until the next morning at 10 AM.</p>
    <p>The tradition originated from the time of slavery, dating back to 17th century. Following Christmas, the slaves were given three days of break to see their friends and relatives. These reunions would consist of music, dancing and lavish costumes.</p>
    <img src="junkanoo.jpg" alt="image description" width="70%" height="auto">
    <p>After slavery was abolished, the tradition was almost forgotten, but some locals kept it alive and now it is tradition at every Christmas, as it symbolizes freedom and love for Christ.</p>
